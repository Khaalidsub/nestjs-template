# Login with a backup code

Hi {{name}},

Someone (hopefully you) logged in to your account from **{{ locationName }}**, and they used a backup code when asked for a two-factor authentication code.

If you didn't login to your account, you should immediately change your password and regenerate your backup codes. You can do that by logging in to your account.
